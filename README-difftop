Welcome to DiffTop version 1.0.0

A code for the calculation of the 
differential and total cross section 
for heavy-quark production at hadron colliders.

Cross sections are calculated in 1PI kinematics 
at LO, approx NLO and approx NNLO in QCD, 
by employing techniques of QCD threshold resummation 
beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy.

Please refer to the following papers 
if you are using this code:

arXiv:1406.0386 [hep-ph];
arXiv:1409.0444 [hep-ph];
arXiv:1308.1635 [hep-ph];

-------------------------
BEFORE THE INSTALLATION.
-------------------------
DiffTop requires the installation of LHAPDF libraries. 
Please download these from  

http://lhapdf.hepforge.org/lhapdf5/

The LHAPDF libraries which are currently 
supported are: lhapdf-5.8.8 up to lhapdf-5.9.1 .



--------------
INSTALLATION.
--------------

1) Untar unzip the file difftop-1.0.0.tar.gz by using 

tar -zxvf difftop-1.0.0.tar.gz

The directories 

~/difftop-1.0.0/ 

is created.


2) Checking the file content: 

The subdirectory: 

~/difftop-1.0.0/doc/

contains the DiffTop-1.0.0 users manual (TeX and PDF) with the description
and usage of the code. Please read Sec. 5 and 6 bofore starting. 




-MAIN FORTRAN FILES-

- setup.sh: a small shell script containing lines to be edited by 
            the user for the correct inclusion of paths 
            for the executables and LHAPDF libraries.


- Makefile:  it allows the user to compile and link the 
             Fortran programs with the \texttt{gfortran} compiler. 
             It might be edited to change the path for 
             the LHAPDF libraries. The default option 
             uses lhapdf-config: 

             LHAPDFLIBPATH = $(shell lhapdf-config --prefix)/lib


- difftop1PI.f: is the main file. It includes the transverse 
                momentum p_T and rapidity y grids generation, 
                and the calls to the Vegas algorithm integration routine.


- integrandpty.f: it includes the logarithmic 
                expansion and it represents 
                the core of the calculation.


- Sfuncts.f: it includes the analytical structure of the 
                hard and soft functions of 
                the threshold resummation formalism.

- hadfold.f: it includes the calls to the PDFs and alpha_s(mu_R). 
             Also, it includes the calls to initialize the LHAPDF libs.


- pac1.f: is a wrapper for the LHAPDF libraries.


- difftop.in: is the user-option input file containing 29 input options. 
              It needs to be edited  according to the 
              requirements of the specific computation.  


- AUXILIARY FILES -

- wgplg.f: auxiliary Fortran subroutine for the 
           calculation of polylogarithmic functions.
           This was distributed in the past by W.L. van Neerven:
           http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/research/neerven/DECEASED/zwprod.uu
           
- vegas.f: is a slightly modified version of the Fortran code 
           which includes the Vegas algorithm. 
           Written by G.P. Lepage and documented and 
           published in J.Comput.Phys. 27 (1978) 192



- COMPILING & LINKING -

Once the correct paths for the LHAPDF libraries 
are included in the shell script "setup.sh",  
the user can source it by running the command:

source setup.sh


For compiling and linking, it is only necessary to type: 

make

The executable file is generated, that is called: 

difftop1PI


-----------------
RUNNING DIFFTOP
-----------------

To run DiffTop in the current directory ./difftop-1.0.0
the user must type the command:

difftop1PI

This starts the evaluation and the value(s) of the total(differential) cross section 
are written in the output file difftop.out once the calculation is terminated.
Please read the Users manual for the description of the user-input file
difftop.in to change the options.


---------
OUTPUT
---------
The output of the calculation is printed in 
the text file difftop.out is explained

TOTAL CROSS SECTION:

If the total cross section is calculated, the output file difftop.out
will contain only 1 single line: 

"sqrt(S)[GeV], sigmatot [pb], Err"

DIFFERENTIAL DISTRIBUTION (pT or y)

If the differential cross section is calculated (pT or y), 
the output file difftop.out will contain only 1 single line: 

For the pT spectrum one has

"pT[GeV], dsigma/pT[pb/GeV],  Err"
...        ...               ...
...        ...               ...

For the rapidity 

"y,        dsigma/dy[pb],    Err"
...        ...               ...
...        ...               ...


The current accuracy of Vegas integration is set in such a way that 
the Born level, elastic and inelastic cross sections, 
are evaluated at the per-mill level.
This can be changed in the difftop1PI.f 
main fortran subroutine by searching 
for the line: 'VEGAS parameters' .
